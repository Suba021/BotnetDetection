# BotnetDetection
Inspiration
Security is a major concern for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to their vulnerabilities, these devices are an easy target for unauthorised access. Traditional security mechanisms are not easily deployed on these tiny devices. In light of this, the inspiration for   botnet detection machine learning model is to promote better security to the people.By using the extensive Intel oneAPI tools we can optimise the model.With this model, people are informed about the health of the machine. Ultimately, this project has the potential to play a significant role in improving  security and reducing vulnerability on a global scale.
